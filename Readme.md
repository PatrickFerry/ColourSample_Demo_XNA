# ColourSample_Demo_XNA

This is a demo made with C# showcasing the ability to debug and interact with controller input with XNA.
Made as part of an assignment I had in third year.

### Controls
Left trigger or the "down" arrow on the keyboard decreases the selected value.
Right trigger or the "up" arrow on the keyboard increases the selected value.

The "D-Pad" or arrow keys on the keyboard will move the pointer.

B on the GamePad or "R" on the keyboard sets the "r" value to full.
A on the GamePad or "G" on the keyboard sets the "g" value to full.
X on the GamePad or "B" on the keyboard sets the "b" value to full.

<sub><sup>All controls are based on the Xbox 360. Drivers for windows are [here](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ie/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows "Xbox 360 Controller Drivers") if not already installed.
A PS3 contoller can also be used on Windows if you install [ScpToolKit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit "Windows Driver and XInput Wrapper for Sony DualShock 3/4 Controllers").</sup></sub>

### Executable
To run the executable you must install the [XNA Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=27598 "Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 Refresh")

### Platform
This was built for all Windows platforms that support XNA.
